# payment-calculator
Simple Javascript payment calculator based on products/prices
Originally developed for my client who runs an annual charity golf tournament. People can pay for golf and dinner, dinner only, and also  sponsorships and donations. Can be adapted for various needs. The total is calculated and can then be used to send to PayPal or other payment processor.
